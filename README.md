# Weekly Reports 

Every week, the German government gets results from public opinion research to understand what people currently care about. [FragDenStaat](https://fragdenstaat.de/) has [requested this data](https://fragdenstaat.de/anfragen/tag/wochenberichte/) under the Freedom of Information Act. The reports are available as PDFs. The womenâ€™s Bachelor degree programme ["Computer science and business administration"](https://fiw.htw-berlin.de/) wrote a parser for that data that reads in the PDFs and writes tabular data to json files. The raw data, the parser and the parsed data can be found in this repository. [webkid](https://webkid.io) did the technical support for the project.
